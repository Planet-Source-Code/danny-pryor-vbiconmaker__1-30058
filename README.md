### Description

This is a true ICON maker.I found it browsing around the world of V.B.<web-browsing,& READING,LOTS of READING!> .Anyways , i've tried out all of the icon utilities here on P.S.C.,found 1 that came close to being great but this,this 1 I have GOT to share with everyone!Supports true <GET|IMAGE|FILE> And has excellnt OutPut of the new Icon you create.While the code is not mine in anyway what-so-ever , I release it here to you on P.S.C. in it's entirety , untouched or altered in anyway and I suggest you do the same because it does'nt need any touch-ups! just enjoy/FREE to ME/FREE to you!This program is about a donkey hair away from being charged for(MY opinion)
